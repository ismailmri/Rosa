# Reflection

All six of the webpages are responsive, the approach for the project was Mobile First and CSS grid and flexbox were mainly used to layout the elements.
Initially, my idea was to create an E-commerce website, however I scrapped the idea completely and decided to make a website about a restaurant called The Rosa. 
I spent way too much time on the Home Page and not enough on some of the other pages.

There are several problems with the webpages, for instance, the News Page was supposed to be a Reservations page and include reservation forms and a lot more JavaScript, however I changed that last minute.
In the future I will improve the website - mainly the styling, add more JavaScript and animations.
